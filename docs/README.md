# Documentation Index

This folder contains the structured project documentation used for delivery, supervisor updates, and dissertation evidence.

## How to Use This Folder

- Read `Week 1` for the frozen project scope and evaluation rules.
- Read `Week 2` for dataset preparation and reproducibility work.
- Read `Week 3` for the first trained model baseline and findings.

## Documentation Principles

The documentation is organized to support three things:
- clear project status by week
- reproducible technical decisions
- evidence that can be reused in the final dissertation

Anything outdated, duplicated, or superseded should be rewritten or removed rather than allowed to accumulate.
