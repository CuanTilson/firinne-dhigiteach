# Documentation Index

This folder contains the structured project documentation used for delivery, supervisor updates, and dissertation evidence.

## Best Starting Points

- `docs/project-status.md` - current overall status and priority view
- `docs/Week 3/week3-model-a-baseline.md` - current baseline training result
- `docs/Week 1/week1-evaluation-protocol.md` - frozen evaluation rules

## How to Use This Folder

- Read `Week 1` for the frozen project scope and evaluation rules.
- Read `Week 2` for dataset preparation and reproducibility work.
- Read `Week 3` for the first trained model baseline and findings.
- Read `Week 4` for audio backend scaffolding and decision-integration planning.

## Documentation Principles

The documentation is organized to support three things:
- clear project status by week
- reproducible technical decisions
- evidence that can be reused in the final dissertation

Anything outdated, duplicated, or superseded should be rewritten or removed rather than allowed to accumulate.

## Historical vs Current

- The weekly folders are historical milestone records.
- `docs/project-status.md` is the current top-level summary.
